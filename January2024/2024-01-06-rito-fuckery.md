## Riot's L Decisions: The Introduction of Vanguard AC to League of Legends
**2024/1/06 - Sorrawit "Chalk" Poomseetong**

Riot Vanguard represents a significant escalation in poublic concerns to game cheating. Developed by Riot Games, a company under a full ownership of Tencent, a major Chinese conglemerate, Vanguard is a "ring 0" anticheat software. This means it operate at the kernel level, the highest privilege level of a computer's operating system, granting it extensive access and control over the whole system.

**Implications**
The addition of Vanguard to League of Legends raises critical questions about privacy and security. In an era where digital autonomy is increasingly valued, the increased intrusion of game companies into the kernel level of our computers is deeply concerning. This not only infringes on consumer privacy, but also poses a security risk. Should a black hat hackers exploit such powerful software, they could lowkey gain an unprecedented access to thier player base.

**Riot's Questionable Track Record**
Riot Games has a reputation for neglecting bug fixes in League of Legends, a game that already has more bugs that a cheap motel. (Also, please fix that Nunu W U-turn) This raises my doubts about their commitment to maintaining the software security of Vanguard. Riot's past approach to software issues is anything to go by, there's legitimate worry about how they will manage a tool sensitive as a kernel-level anticheat.

**Difficulty in Opting Out**
Vanguard is notoriously challenging to disable. Many users, for the sake of convenience or lack of knowledge, leave it running continuously, even when not playing League of Legends. This constant operation raises further concerns about the extent of surveillance and system control exercised by Riot. (and questionably also CCP)

**Potential of Domino Effect**
Riot's decision to integrate Vanguard into League of Legends might set a precedent for other gaming companies. This could lead to a widespread adoption of intrusive anticheat systems, exacerbating the issues of privacy invasion and system vulnerability.

**Riot, Please Fix: my "Wishlist" to return playing LOL**
To address these concerns, Riot should consider these actions:
1. **Implement an Easy Opt-Out Switch**
2. **Open Source the Anti Cheat Launcher**
3. **Enhance Transparency Around Data Telemetry**
