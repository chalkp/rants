In the vast landscape of Internet, the way content is managed and shared can significantly impact creativity and community engagement. This brings us to an intriguing comparison: the community-driven approach of Touhou versus the money-centric model of corporate dominated Internet content.

**Community-Driven Model of Touhou project**
"The Touhou Model" presents an ideal spirit of Internet content licensing. It was built on minimal copyright restrictions, fostering a rich community of creators and fans. The approach promotes collaboration and innovation, allowing for a diverse range of content that reflects the genuine passions and creativity of the worldwide Touhou community. Unlike the corporate model, Touhouâ€™s framework is built on mutual respect between ZUN, doujin creators and the community, focusing on the art rather than the actual profit.

**The Dark Side of Corporate Dominance**
In contrast, the majority of Internet content today falls under the control of a few major corporations, primarily from the United States and China. These hostile entities enforce stringent copyright laws and restrictive practices, prioritizing financial gains over freedom of creativity. This model stifles innovation, limits diversity, **and creates an atmosphere where legal fears and profit motives overshadow the true spirit of creativity**. It leads to a homogenized landscape of content, where unique voices struggle to be heard amidst the clamor for monetization.

**The Impact on Freedom of Speech**
An additional critical concern arising from the corporate-dominated approach to Internet content is its potential impact on freedom of speech. This control risks leading to censorship and the **suppression of non-conforming ideas**, undermining the diversity of thought crucial to a healthy democratic society. In this environment, creativity and freedom of expression are also stifled, and the Internet's potential as a platform for unrestricted discourse diminishes. The risk here is significant: the Internet, once a heaven for free expression, became a controlled space where only a certain narratives thrive. This trend highlights the urgent need for a commitment to openness and freedom in the **free and fair** digital world, ensuring the Internet remains a diverse space for all voices.

**What should be done to Reduce Corporate Influence**
To mitigate corporate dominance in Internet content, the world governments must take decisive action. They should **enforce antitrust laws more rigorously to foster free and fair competition** and put more support to smaller content creators. Advocating for **net neutrality** is essential to prevent preferential treatment of certain narratives by Internet service providers. International collaboration is crucial to establish standards that protect online freedom of expression and diversity. These measures will help maintain the Internet as an open platform for innovation and a diverse global community.
