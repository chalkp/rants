## Welcome to Read My Fucking Rants
You've stumbled upon **chalkp/rants**. This is **my** corner on the internet where I rant and spit truths (or what I believe to be truths) about everything under the sun. If you're looking for sugar-coated opinions or politically correct narratives, **fuck off**.

## Warning: Not for the Easily Triggered and those corporate sheeps
I'm here to speak my fucked up mind, unfiltered and raw. If you can't handle a blunt and in-your-face opinions, **fuck off**.

## Warning: This repo is intended to be controversial
If you've got a counterpoint or a rant to match mine, go ahead and make my day. Open Issues.

## Getting Started
This repository is a collection of markdown files, each a dose of thoughts on topics I find infuriating, absurd, or worth wasting my precious university admission study time.

## KNOW THE LIMITS
I'm all in for free and fair speech, but don't push it too far. These rants is all about infuriating systemic problems. Harassment, hate speech, bullying, or any issues opened that is going to get me in trouble with GitHub's fucking rules, and you're out. **Fuck off**.

**Dive into each markdown at your own mental risk. Just remember, you chose to be here. Don't say I didn't warn you.**

(These shits should not be taken seriously, Chalk is just a wittwe smol bwoyo that just loves being overdramatic about these issues)
